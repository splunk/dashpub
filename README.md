# Dashboard Publisher

**EXPERIMENTAL** tool that creates a Next.js project for a given list of Splunk dashboards, optionally making the dashboards accessible to anyone using [Vercel](https://vercel.com). Search results are proxied through serverless functions, which handle authentication and efficient CDN caching.
